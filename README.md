# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game supports a two-player mode, allowing two players to take turns marking spaces on the board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Two-player mode: Play against a friend locally on the same device.
- Responsive design: Playable on desktop and mobile devices.
- Win detection: The game automatically detects winning combinations and declares a winner.
- Draw detection: If all spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
- Reset button: Easily reset the game to play again.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game will start with an empty Tic Tac Toe board.
3. Player 1 (X) starts the game by clicking on an empty space on the board.
4. Player 2 (O) takes their turn by clicking on another empty space.
5. Players continue taking turns until one player achieves three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or until the board is full.
6. If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message will appear announcing the result.
7. To play again, click the "Reset" button to clear the board and start a new game.
